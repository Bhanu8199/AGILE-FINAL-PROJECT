*As a* store administrator, 
*I need* the ability to create a product in the catalog, 
*So that* I can offer products for sale.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

*   Given I have valid product data (name, description, price, etc.), 
    When I submit the product creation request, 
    Then the product should be successfully created in the catalog.
*   Given I submit a product creation request with missing required fields, 
    When I submit the request, 
    Then the system should display an error message indicating the missing fields.
